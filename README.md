## 📌 PROJECT NAME:

**SQL_Employee_Management_Project**: A SQL-based Employee Data Management and Analysis Project

---

## 🧾 ABOUT PROJECT:

This SQL project focuses on employee attendance, in-office tracking, and HR-based data management using stored procedures, views, and analytical queries.  
It aims to simplify routine HR operations such as employee check-in analysis, WFO attendance tracking, and department-level reporting.

The procedures help HR teams or managers fetch structured reports based on specific filters like date, employee ID, or department.  
The queries are well-optimized and written with real-time data requirements in mind.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used:

- 🐬 MySQL (Procedures, Views, Functions)
- 📊 Excel (for raw data structure and testing)
- 📁 GitHub (for version control)
- 📚 SQL Queries & Optimization

---

## 🔍 STEPS OVERVIEW:

1. Understand the structure of employee data
2. Create stored procedures for attendance and WFO tracking
3. Develop views for quick analysis
4. Optimize queries using indexing and filtering
5. Validate and test queries using sample datasets

---

## 🧹 DATA CLEANING:

- Remove duplicates based on `emp_id`
- Handle NULLs in `check_in` / `check_out` timestamps
- Format date fields consistently
- Trim and standardize text fields
- Ensure referential integrity using constraints

## 🧠 DASHBOARD OR OUTPUT:

While this is primarily a SQL backend project, the output of these procedures can be used to create dashboards in **Power BI**, **Excel**, or **Tableau** for insights like:

- Daily Attendance Report
- WFO vs WFH Analysis
- Department-Wise Presence Summary
